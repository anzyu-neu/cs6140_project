NBA ML Gambling 

Objectives copied over from the project proposal
{Objectives}

The goal of this project is to develop a model to analyze NBA teams' point totals to gamble on the NBA spread or over/under markets. In general when placing straight bets on spread or over/under markets, a 52\% win rate is considered "successful" when accounting for the sports book's commission. With a developed model in hand, the team will assess the success rate by placing imaginary bets on the 2024-2024 NBA season. Public NBA data from the past 5 years along with a variety of other external features will be utilized for model development. 

This project holds particular interest to the team given our mutual interest in sports and the increased relevance of sports gambling in the United States. Of the three major leagues in the United States' sports culture, the NBA is an ideal league. The NFL holds too few games, allowing for more random noise. The MLB holds far too many games, and baseball, as a sports, holds little interest to the team.
