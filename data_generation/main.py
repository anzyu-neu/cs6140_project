# Instructions to run:
# Replace the season in write_season_stats and the program will generate the stats per game in the output_data.
# There most likely will be a timeout error while running the program. The program will cache the season data
# to the appropriate file in game_stats before exiting. Wait approximately a minute or so to avoid getting
# blocked on nba_api and re-run the program. It will load the cached data and resume from there.
